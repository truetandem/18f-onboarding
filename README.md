# Onboarding for 18F Projects

## Communication

Discussions may take place through various channels. Typically there will be the following:

 - Video Conferencing
 - E-mail
 - Developer channels
 - And internal channels

### Video conferencing

This medium is leveraged mainly for sprints, reviews, and retrospectives with
the customer. The ability to screenshare current progress and work items is
beneficial to all participants.

### E-mail

Leverage e-mail for communication with wide audiences when immediate response
is not necessary or information is more informational rather than actionable
for particular members.

It is also ideal for coordination of meetings and scheduled moments of the
project lifecycle.

### Developer channels

This should be decided on early in the project. The intentions of these channels
are to quickly pass information to key members of 18F and TrueTandem during the
course of the project. We can accomplish this by using services such as:

 - Gitter
 - Slack
 - Google Hangouts
 - Mattermost

Whichever method is selected it is paramount to use it for collaboration and to
be as open as possible.

### Internal channels

The team primarily uses Google Hangouts for chat and video conferencing. Although
depending on the team SSH with a terminal multiplexor (like tmux) is leveraged
when screensharing is not ideal.

## Project Management

### Get to know GitHub

Rest assured GitHub will be utilized in some aspect during the project. Be
comfortable interfacing with their services, handling issues, and working
with pull requests.

### Be flexible

Each project may differ as far as the tools leveraged for project management.
Coming to understand this early may save in undo worry, stress, and
frustration.

Just remember everything is a big TODO list with metrics and workflows
applied. Be open to different work processes and adapt with what fits
most with the stakeholders.
